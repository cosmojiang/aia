# Run Faster RCNN using Tensorflow Models for flower detection

1. Install Tensorflow Models 
2. Download the files in this folder
3. Open a terminal and activate your python virtual environment
4. Direct to the folder ~/YOUR_PATH/models/research
5. use the following command to train your model using transfer learning
```shell
$ python object_detection/train.py --logtostderr \
> 
```
