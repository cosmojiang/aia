My name is Yu Jiang a Ph.D. candidate in the Biosensing and Instrumentation Lab at the University of Georgia. An important branch of my research is to use AI techniques to address various challenging issues being faced by agricultural research communities and industries. This repository will be updated with datasets, codes, and tutorials that cover my research projects, which serves for the concept of 'Open Science and Open Data'.
